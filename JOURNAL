# 6/24 Flamethrower Project: Energy Content of Cleaning Solutions & Household Fuels

## Goal

The goal is to make a flamethrower out of some kind of **"cleaning solution."**  
I should be able to add other stuff like WD-40, maybe even AXE bc funnies.

Some flammable stuff that is cool includes:
- Hand sanitizer → when I tested it, it made cool flameballs.
- WD-40 → seems like it's good.
- I also want to test how AXE performs.

To do this, I want to understand how the fire works.

## 🔬 Initial Chemistry

### Basic Combustion Reaction:
CH₄ (g) + 2 O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + 2 H₂O (g)


The original idea was to compare how much **methane (CH₄)** is present per dollar and per gram in these fuels.  
After further research, this wasn’t useful — most of these fuels don’t contain methane directly.

---

## 📈 New Approach: Use Energy Content (MJ/kg)

I will now compare the **chemical energy content** of each fuel source (in MJ/kg), and eventually determine **how much energy you get per dollar** ($/MJ).

The idea is to see whether this project is practical by comparing **energy density** and **cost-efficiency**.

---

## 🧪 Fuel Energy Content Research

### 1. Methane (CH₄)
- Enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°c): −890 kJ/mol  
- Molar mass: 16 g/mol

**Calculation:** Energy per kg = 890 kJ/mol ÷ 0.016 kg/mol = 55,625 kJ/kg ≈ 55.6 MJ/kg


---

### 2. Kerosene
> Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene

- Lower Heating Value (LHV): **43.1 MJ/kg**
- Higher Heating Value (HHV): 46.2 MJ/kg

I will use **LHV = 43.1 MJ/kg** since it represents net energy after water remains as vapor.

---

### 3. Diesel
> Source: https://www.iru.org/system/files/Diesel%20Litre%20Equivalent%20(DLE).pdf

- Lower Heating Value (LHV): **43.0 MJ/kg**

---

### 4. Ethanol
> Source: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-heat-of-combustion-energy-content-d_1987.html

- ΔH°c = 1366.91 kJ/mol
- Molar mass = 48.08 g/mol

**Calculation:** (1366.91 × 1000) ÷ 48.08 = 28,435 kJ/kg ≈ 29.7 MJ/kg


---

### 5. WD-40
> Source: https://www.wd40.com/myths-legends-fun-facts/

WD-40 contains **petroleum distillates**, which are similar in energy to **kerosene**.

⚠️ No official energy content data available.

**Assumption:** WD-40 ≈ 43.1 MJ/kg 


---

### 6. AXE Body Spray

AXE contains a mixture of flammable ingredients, but no published energy content exists.  
To estimate, I used the MSDS here:  
https://www.whatsinproducts.com/files/brands_pdf/9618_21010028%20MSDS%20Axe%20Proximity%20Deodorant%20Bodyspray,%20Bergamot.pdf

#### Ingredient Composition (Approx. Averages):
- Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B): 52.5%
- Isobutane: 35%
- Butane: 35%
- Hydrofluorocarbon 152a: 30%
- Propane: 7.5%

⚠️ Total is **160%**, not 100% → normalize final value by dividing total energy by 1.6

---

### 🔢 AXE Body Spray Energy Breakdown

#### Propane (7.5%)
> Source: https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C74986&Mask=FFF 0.075 × 46.4 = 3.48 MJ/kg


---

#### Hydrofluorocarbon-152a (30%)
> Assumed ~16.5 MJ/kg

0.30 × 16.5 = 4.95 MJ/kg

the goal is to make a flamethrower out of some "cleaning solution".

I should be able to add other stuff like wd40 maybe cuX WHY NOT 

stuff flamable that is cool is hand sanatizer when I did it cool flameballs
wd40 seems like its good
wanna see how axe does tho
for that, I wanna understand how the fire would work.

since CH₄ (g) + 2 O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + 2 H₂O (g), the idea is to see what has more CH₄ per dollar and per gram. 

after further research, thisd isnt entirely good fgor my purpose since methane is not present in ther other chems. Instead I will use approximations of Energy (MJ/kg)
How much chemical energy is in each fuel source.

How much you pay per unit of that energy ($/MJ).

The idea is to se if this project is practical.


1. Methane (CH₄) → ~55.5 MJ/kg
Calculation:
Methane’s combustion reaction:
CH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O + Energy
The enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°c) for methane is −890 kJ/mol.

Molar mass of CH₄ = 16 g/mol

Energy per kg = (890 kJ/mol) / (0.016 kg/mol) = 55,625 kJ/kg ≈ 55.6 MJ/kg



CxHy + (x + y/4) O₂ → x CO₂ + (y/2) H₂O

acc nvm ill just do it like this

Instead of trying to calculate it ive been trying for hours without good results, ill just see what other sources say 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene the footnote source is paid for access but "The heat of combustion of kerosene is similar to that of diesel fuel; its lower heating value is 43.1 MJ/kg (around 18,500 Btu/lb), and its higher heating value is 46.2 MJ/kg (19,900 Btu/lb).[15]"

Since The lower heating value (LHV) of 43.1 MJ/kg represents the net energy released when the water produced during combustion remains as vapor, I will consider the MJ/KG as 43.1.
https://www.iru.org/system/files/Diesel%20Litre%20Equivalent%20(DLE).pdf#:~:text=LD%20%3D%2043MJ%2Fkg%20for%20diesel according to this, the MJ/kg of desiel is 43MJ/kg

https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-heat-of-combustion-energy-content-d_1987.html For ethonal, "The heat of combustion of ethanol, ΔHc °(C2H6 O, l) = 1366.91(kJ/mol) ×1000(g/kg) / 48.08 (g/mol) = 29664 kJ/kg ethanol  = 29.7 MJ/kg = 12754 BTU/lb = 7086 kcal/kg"

For WP40, this remains very tricky; no tests weer dont and the chemical composition is nto aviabable anywhere. I searched for hours and this took a majority of my research time. However, as per https://www.wd40.com/myths-legends-fun-facts/, " WD-40 Multi-Use Product contains petroleum distillates "
For that reason, ill asssociate it with kerosenes: [fill in]

Unfortunatly, for Axe Body Spray, Personal care products lack energy content testing. Flammable propellants (e.g., butane: ~49 MJ/kg) contribute to combustion risk but are not quantified for the mixture. https://www.whatsinproducts.com/files/brands_pdf/9618_21010028%20MSDS%20Axe%20Proximity%20Deodorant%20Bodyspray,%20Bergamot.pdf has a list of these, which allow me to calculate that since - Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B): 40–65%
- Isobutane: 30–40%
- Butane: 30–40%
- Hydrofluorocarbon 152a: 20–40%
- Propane: 5–10%

averages of this would be 7.5 propane, 30 percent - Hydrofluorocarbon 152a, - Butane 35 percent, Isobutane 35 percent, and 52.5 for - Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), which in total is  160%, not 100$.
