# 6/24 Flamethrower Project: Energy Content of Cleaning Solutions & Household Fuels

## 🎯 Goal

The goal is to make a flamethrower out of some kind of **"cleaning solution."**  
I should be able to add other stuff like WD-40, maybe even AXE bc funnies.

Some flammable stuff that is cool includes:
- **Hand sanitizer** → when I tested it, it made cool flameballs
- **WD-40** → seems like it's good
- **AXE Body Spray** → want to test how it performs

To do this, I want to understand how the fire works.

## 🔬 Initial Chemistry Approach

### Basic Combustion Reaction:
```
CH₄ (g) + 2 O₂ (g) → CO₂ (g) + 2 H₂O (g)
```

The original idea was to compare how much **methane (CH₄)** is present per dollar and per gram in these fuels.  
After further research, this wasn't useful — most of these fuels don't contain methane directly.

### General Hydrocarbon Combustion:
```
CₓHᵧ + (x + y/4) O₂ → x CO₂ + (y/2) H₂O
```

## 📈 New Approach: Energy Content (MJ/kg)

Instead of trying to calculate methane content, I will now compare the **chemical energy content** of each fuel source (in MJ/kg), and eventually determine **how much energy you get per dollar** ($/MJ).

The idea is to see whether this project is practical by comparing **energy density** and **cost-efficiency**.

## 🧪 Fuel Energy Content Research

### 1. Methane (CH₄)
- **Enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°c):** −890 kJ/mol  
- **Molar mass:** 16 g/mol

**Calculation:** 
```
Energy per kg = 890 kJ/mol ÷ 0.016 kg/mol = 55,625 kJ/kg ≈ 55.6 MJ/kg
```

**Result:** **~55.6 MJ/kg**

---

### 2. Kerosene
> **Source:** [Wikipedia - Kerosene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerosene)

- **Lower Heating Value (LHV):** **43.1 MJ/kg**
- **Higher Heating Value (HHV):** 46.2 MJ/kg

I will use **LHV = 43.1 MJ/kg** since it represents net energy after water remains as vapor.

**Result:** **43.1 MJ/kg**

---

### 3. Diesel
> **Source:** [IRU - Diesel Litre Equivalent](https://www.iru.org/system/files/Diesel%20Litre%20Equivalent%20(DLE).pdf)

- **Lower Heating Value (LHV):** **43.0 MJ/kg**

**Result:** **43.0 MJ/kg**

---

### 4. Ethanol
> **Source:** [Engineering Toolbox - Heat of Combustion](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-heat-of-combustion-energy-content-d_1987.html)

- **ΔH°c =** 1366.91 kJ/mol
- **Molar mass =** 48.08 g/mol

**Calculation:** 
```
(1366.91 × 1000) ÷ 48.08 = 28,435 kJ/kg ≈ 29.7 MJ/kg
```

**Result:** **29.7 MJ/kg**

---

### 5. WD-40
> **Source:** [WD-40 Myths & Legends](https://www.wd40.com/myths-legends-fun-facts/)

WD-40 contains **petroleum distillates**, which are similar in energy to **kerosene**.

⚠️ **Note:** No official energy content data available.

**Assumption:** WD-40 ≈ 43.1 MJ/kg (same as kerosene)

**Result:** **~43.1 MJ/kg**

---

### 6. AXE Body Spray

AXE contains a mixture of flammable ingredients, but no published energy content exists.  
To estimate, I used the MSDS here:  
[AXE Proximity Deodorant Bodyspray MSDS](https://www.whatsinproducts.com/files/brands_pdf/9618_21010028%20MSDS%20Axe%20Proximity%20Deodorant%20Bodyspray,%20Bergamot.pdf)

#### Ingredient Composition (Approx. Averages):
- **Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B):** 52.5%
- **Isobutane:** 35%
- **Butane:** 35%
- **Hydrofluorocarbon 152a:** 30%
- **Propane:** 7.5%

⚠️ **Important:** Total is **160%**, not 100% → normalize final value by dividing total energy by 1.6

### 🔢 AXE Body Spray Energy Breakdown

#### Propane (7.5%)
> **Source:** [NIST WebBook - Propane](https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C74986&Mask=FFF)

- **ΔcH°gas:** -2219.2 ± 0.46 kJ/mol
- **Molar mass:** 44.0956 g/mol
- **Energy content:** 46.4 MJ/kg (net value)

**Calculation:** `0.075 × 46.4 = 3.48 MJ/kg`

#### Hydrofluorocarbon-152a (30%)
> **Assumed energy content:** ~16.5 MJ/kg

**Calculation:** `0.30 × 16.5 = 4.95 MJ/kg`

#### Butane (35%)
> **Energy content:** 45.7 MJ/kg (net value from standard fuel tables)

**Calculation:** `0.35 × 45.7 = 15.995 MJ/kg`

#### Isobutane (35%)
> **Energy content:** 45.6 MJ/kg

**Calculation:** `0.35 × 45.6 = 15.96 MJ/kg`

#### Alcohol Denat. (52.5%)
> **Energy content:** ~30 MJ/kg (estimated for denatured alcohol)

**Calculation:** `0.525 × 30 = 15.75 MJ/kg`

### 📊 AXE Body Spray Total Energy Calculation

1. **Add all component energies:**
   ```
   3.48 + 4.95 + 15.995 + 15.96 + 15.75 = 56.135 MJ/kg
   ```

2. **Normalize by total percentage (160% = 1.6):**
   ```
   56.135 ÷ 1.6 = 35.08 MJ/kg
   ```

**Final Result:** **~35.1 MJ/kg**

## 📋 Summary of Energy Contents

| Fuel | Energy Content (MJ/kg) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Methane | 55.6 | Highest energy density |
| Kerosene | 43.1 | Standard reference |
| Diesel | 43.0 | Similar to kerosene |
| WD-40 | ~43.1 | Estimated (petroleum distillates) |
| AXE Body Spray | ~35.1 | Calculated from components |
| Ethanol | 29.7 | Lowest of tested fuels |

## 🔍 Next Steps

1. **Cost Analysis:** Calculate $/MJ for each fuel
2. **Safety Testing:** Verify flammability and burn characteristics
3. **Practical Testing:** Build and test flamethrower prototypes
4. **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate flame quality, duration, and safety

## 📝 Notes

- **Hand sanitizer** showed promising results with "cool flameballs"
- **WD-40** appears to be a good candidate due to high energy density
- **AXE Body Spray** has moderate energy content but may have interesting burn characteristics
- All calculations are approximations and should be verified experimentally
- **Safety first:** This is for educational/research purposes only
